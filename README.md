## Main Goal / Concept
Learning about CPU-Scheduling policies. => Look at the CFS/ULE/Something that is actually used today. Also implement some basic stuff myself in python
## Scratchpad (for ideas)
Another thing that I could do is a C++ implementation of one of the algorithms. Lottery/Stride would be probably the best, because that's where I have most of my material and is (rather) simple compared to something like CFS (just a guess).
## Report 2024-08-25
### What I have done
- General information gathering
- Looking at the basics and overview of approches
- created notes in org
### What I haven't done
- Write / Think about the Handout
- Write Code
### What I am planning to do
- especially theory for now
- dive into lottery / stride scheduling more
  - ??implementation??
- reading through a comparison between the FreeBSD (Ule) and Linux (CFS) scheduler
- bit of datastructure (red-black tree)
- if not enough material:
  - multi CPU
  - adjusting parameters using machine learning (prob won't touch it)

## Report 2024-10-20: First Draft (Probekapitel):

- Will do:: Introduce time complexity?
  - Move a Metrics Part: Introduce time complexity?
    - Also reread the performance part of the phd-667.pdf
  - Implement Comments in .tex file
    - labeled as "% COMMENT:"
