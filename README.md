## Main Goal / Concept
Learning about CPU-Scheduling policies. => Look at the CFS/ULE/Something that is actually used today. Also implement some basic stuff myself in python
## Scratchpad (for ideas)
Another thing that I could do is a C++ implementation of one of the algorithms. Lottery/Stride would be probably the best, because that's where I have most of my material and is (rather) simple compared to something like CFS (just a guess).
## Report 2024-08-25
### What I have done
- General information gathering
- Looking at the basics and overview of approches
- created notes in org
### What I haven't done
- Write / Think about the Handout
- Write Code
### What I am planning to do
- especially theory for now
- dive into lottery / stride scheduling more
  - ??implementation??
- reading through a comparison between the FreeBSD (Ule) and Linux (CFS) scheduler
- bit of datastructure (red-black tree)
- if not enough material:
  - multi CPU
  - adjusting parameters using machine learning (prob won't touch it)

## 2024-11-11
as of today I've decided to completely scape the entire "article.tex" and the previous notes, because it was just a mess and had no real concept.
continuing that would've only made things more difficult later on. 
even though this means practically starting from the beginning i still think that it makes more sense
