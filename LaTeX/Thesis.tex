        In this chapter I will give a quick introduction to the basics of CPU scheduling. We will look at the proper terms and common approaches to solving the problem of how one should schedule the processes waiting to be run.

        After looking at the Basics it is time to dive deeper. Here we will learn about policies that do not rely on the burst time to function. This means that technically they can be used in a real world application. In reality however they are usually first modified to fit the environment and the needs better.
